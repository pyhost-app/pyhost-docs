# Servers
The server page on pyhost is your base for doing all things server-level (makes sense, right?). From here you can create and delete __databases__, __SSH keys__, __environment variables__. Use the links below to jump to the section you want more information on.

  - [Databases](/docs/databases/)
  - [SSH Keys](/docs/ssh-keys/)
  - [Environment Varibales](/docs/environment-variables/)


## Connect to your Git Host
The first view of the server page you see will look like this

![connect a git host](/assets/img/githost-connect.png)

Select whichever githost you use to connect to your server and this will take you to that site to allow the connection of the PyHost app so that the system can read your git repositories and create webhooks for easy deployment.

When your connection is complete then you can start creating [sites](/docs/sites) on your server.
